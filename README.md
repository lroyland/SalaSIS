# What is Sala? 
Sala is a free custom-designed open source student information system for records management, grading, 
scheduling and report generation. Teachers save time and are able to focus on providing higher 
quality of teaching based on accurate data and efficient class management. Data analysis coming 
from the platform allows to quickly identify areas of improvement for schools and problems faced 
by students and teachers.

school. The solution enables quick and easy communication between parents, students, teachers and 
schools as relevant information is accessible in a few clicks. Students will be involved in the 
development of the platform of which they will have a deep understanding. This will engage them 
more with their studies and enhance their employability through training and practical experience.
